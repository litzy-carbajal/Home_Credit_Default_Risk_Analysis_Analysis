# Maverik Sales Forecasting Time Series Analysis 
**Final Capstone Group Project Fall 2023**

## Business Problem and Project Objective   
The Maverik capstone project sought to tackle the task of expanding the business presence with the addition of around 30 new stores in the next year. The key goals included forecasting the daily sales of these new stores, refining accuracy in financial planning forecasts, and enhancing the precision of Initial Return on Investment (ROI) calculations.

## Our group solution
The solution we put forth entailed creating a robust predictive model through Time Series analysis. This involved forecasting annual sales for the forthcoming year, recommending strategies to boost sales, and pinpointing the key variables that influence predictions for Maverik

## Contribution 
My involvement in the project encompassed conducting thorough exploratory data analysis and Time Series Model development. During EDA, I extensively analyzed the datasets, identifying patterns and trends to comprehend the data's underlying structure. This crucial step informed subsequent modeling processes. For Time Series Models, I utilized various techniques to capture and predict sales patterns over time, incorporating features and evaluating metrics such as RMSE. I tried implementing the SARIMA model but the results were not impactful for what we were looking to achieve. Overall, my efforts in EDA and Time Series Modeling aimed to offer valuable insights into Maverik's sales dataand also complementing even better with my team's contributions.

## Business Value
The implemented solution brought about transformative benefits for Maverik by improving inventory management, minimizing waste, and optimizing price allocation. With accurate sales predictions and insights into influential variables, the system contributed to a more informed and strategic approach to overall financial planning. This comprehensive enhancement in operational efficiency resulted in significant positive impacts across the organization.

## Challenges along the way
During our analysis, we encountered several challenges related to computational intensity, prompting our team to focus on optimizing the time series code. This optimization allowed for predictions based on a more condensed dataset, specifically a few weeks' worth of data. Addressing initial concerns regarding data sufficiency, we implemented feature engineering techniques to extract more meaningful and relevant insights. These adaptations were crucial in overcoming computational constraints and enhancing the overall effectiveness of the project.

## Lessons learned
The project imparted valuable lessons, notably in addressing the challenges associated with managing four target variables simultaneously. Handling this complexity underscored the importance of refining feature engineering techniques to extract more meaningful insights from the data. Additionally, the project emphasized the significance of effective communication within the team, as clear collaboration proved crucial in navigating the intricacies of the task. Moreover, the experience highlighted the continual need to enhance modeling skills, as the project underscored the dynamic nature of predictive modeling in a real-world context.
